# Lead-Scoring-Mode
#To solve this problem, follow these steps:

Load the dataset and handle any missing values by replacing them with a common value such as '9b2d5b4678781e53038e91ea5324530a03f27dc1d0e5f6c9bc9d493a23be9de0'.
Drop the rows where the STATUS column is not 'WON' or 'LOST'.
Perform feature selection based on domain knowledge or using methods such as correlation analysis or mutual information gain.
Convert all columns to categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model to predict the lead score based on the selected features.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.
